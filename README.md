# Dots and lines

## Overview

In order to test your skills and get an idea of your programming ability we would like you to have a go at a small code challenge we have put together.

## Objectives

Convert the [provided video example](../blob/master/video-example.mov) into a real-time animation using JavaScript.

Please do not get hung up on small details, in this case we are merely trying to assess how good your coding ability is and your ability to solve problems.  Use the video example simply as a reference for what we are looking for.

The video is also available on youtube for your convenience

alt="Example video" width="480" height="360" /></a>

## Rules for your animation

- Your animation should contain at least 100 dots
- Dots should move around the screen to random positions
- Draw a line from each dot to all other dots that are within a 100px radius of itself
- The opacity/color of a line that connects 2 dots should be determined by the distance between the 2 dots, larger distances should produce lighter lines.

## Mandatories

- Use as little code as possible.
- Must have decent browser compatibility

## Bonus points for

- Your animation runs at 60fps on our test devices
- Well written JavaScript (code reuse, OO where applicable)
- Sensible markup
- Please feel free to throw in any cool stuff such as transitions/effects

## Deliverables
- All assets/files needed to show a working version of your animation.
	- You can send us a link to your repo on github
	- Or you can email the assets/files
- In addition, you may provide a hosted link.
